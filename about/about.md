## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hello <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, a simple guy who loves technology. Being an advocate for open source, I like to collaborate and write future-proof code for humans as computers doesn't have preferences. I also want to automate every job out there that doesn't fully utilize human-level intellect, paving the way for a more fulfilling existence, where job doesn't define ones status. And Artificial Intelligence can make that happen.

It would be great to see functional programming gaining traction.

Web Apps might soon dominate native apps, technologies like WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebXR, and WebTransport has recently hads caught my attension.

I want to explore prallelism, and completely change the landscape of Computing till date with General-Purpose Graphics Processing (GPGPUs).
Pushing everyone to re-evaluate existing algorithms and rethink Operating Systems from scratch.

I also want to see the Open Architecture RISC-V succeed.

Embracing Extended Reality (XR) as the future, I wish to contribute to its advancement.

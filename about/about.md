## About Me 👨‍💻

Hello <span class="wave">👋</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, a tech enthusiast who also likes to write future proof code.
With my recent foray into blogging, I would like to share the knowledge I've accumulated.

My fascination lies in the potential of Artificial Intelligence and its transformative impact across various domains.

I aspire to see functional programming paradigms gaining traction and becoming mainstream, driven by their elegance and efficiency.

I'm deeply enthusiastic about cutting-edge technologies such as WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebXR, and WebTransport, envisioning a future where the web experience transcends current boundaries and offers immersive, seamless interactions.

My curiosity extends to exploring the potential of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and microkernels, while eagerly anticipating the evolution of RISC-V architecture, which holds promise for open, customizable computing.

Embracing Extended Reality (XR) as the future, I'm excited to navigate the ever-evolving landscape and contribute to its advancement.

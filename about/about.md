## About Me 👨‍💻

Hello <span class="wave">👋</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, and tech is my dose of dopamine. As an open-source enthusiast, I love collaborating and writing code that's future-proof code for humans because turing machine don’t have preferences but humans do.
I’m also passionate about automating tasks that don’t fully tap into human creativity, aiming for a life where jobs don’t define our worth. Artificial Intelligence can help make that a reality.

It’d be awesome to see functional programming getting more attention.

I believe with technologies like WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebXR, and WebTransport, the web might soon take over the native space.

I'm excited about exploring parallelism and changing the game with General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), pushing everyone to rethink algorithms and build new operating systems from scratch.

I’m also rooting for the open architecture RISC-V to succeed.

Looking ahead, I’m all in on Extended Reality (XR) and eager to contribute to its growth.

Design principles play a crucial role in guiding the flow of components within software products, ultimately making them easier to maintain over the long term. This process can be visualized as reducing a complex, multidimensional **graph** into a simpler 2D representation, ideally forming a **tree** structure without cycles. Many new design principles often complicate concepts that have been around since the 1970s, that is **Independence** and **Composition**, which are foundational to **modular design**. These allow for easy swapping of components, much like breaking a branch from a tree along with its child branches, making room for a new branch to grow.

## Independence

**Independence** is a key principle that emphasizes treating each component in a software system as a separate entity. Here are the main points:

- **Black Box Concept**: Each component should function as a "black box," where only the input and output matter. This allows developers to focus on interactions without needing to understand internal details.

- **Easy Swapping**: Components can be easily replaced without modifying the entire system, provided they adhere to the same input/output contracts.

- **Loose Coupling**: Minimizing dependencies between components ensures that changes in one component do not affect others, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

- **High Cohesion**: Each component should have a single well-defined purpose, making it easier to understand and manage independently.

## Composition

**Composition** focuses on how independent components work together to create a cohesive system. Here are the key aspects:

- **Abstraction**: Composition uses abstractions to define how independent modules interact, allowing them to function together smoothly. For example, user management and content creation modules can communicate through defined interfaces.

- **Enhanced Organization**: Composition creates a structured codebase where modules are logically connected, simplifying navigation and understanding. This hides the complexities of lower-level implementations.

- **Reusability**: Composable components can be reused across different systems or projects, reducing redundancy and improving development efficiency.

## Can They Fit Common Design Principles?

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Composability avoids repetition by combining independent components, ensuring that functionality is implemented only once.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Independence ensures that components remain simple and focused on their single responsibility, while composability helps abstract away unnecessary complexity.

### SOLID Principles

- **S**: **Single Responsibility Principle**  
Each component should have one reason to change. Independence ensures that each module handles a specific task, making it easier to update without affecting other components. For example, a logging module should only be responsible for logging.

- **O**: **Open/Closed Principle**
Components should be open for extension but closed for modification. Composition allows you to add new functionalities by creating new modules instead of altering existing ones. For instance, adding a new payment method can be achieved by composing a new payment module.

- **L**: **Liskov Substitution Principle**  
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. While very specific to **objects** and unrelated to independence and composition, this can still be achieved via functions where parameter defines the associated properties and behaviour. So, instead of object we can substitute parameters. 

- **I**: **Interface Segregation Principle**  
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages creating smaller, more focused interfaces. Composibility achieves the same goal naturally, by combining independent parts.

- **D**: **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low-level modules. Compositions in the layer between high and low level modules acts as the needed abstraction.

## Deployment Architecture

### Modular Monolith

A monolith barely has any constraints, allowing the application of both Independence and Composition principles, enabling a modular system where components are swappable at each level.

### Microservices

Similar to a modular monolith, this architecture utilizes APIs for interactions rather than direct function calls. This setup allows a team to work on and deploy their service independently while removing technology stack-related constraints.

Unless for a local-first product, the database management system (DBMS) should preferably be independent from the rest, even for monoliths. This independence facilitates the easy expansion of services from existing data and allows for independent auditing and changes according to future requirements.

## Organizational Design

These are the guidelines for organizing the codebase. Let's explore the popular **Clean Architecture.**

Notice how different layers are represented in various colors, as you move from the outer levels toward the center, the degree of composition decreases while independence increases. Also, components that belongs to same layers are independent of each other. Other designs like Hexagonal and Onion architecture are also related to these concepts.

## Conclusion

In the end, effective software architecture comes down to balancing independence and composition. By designing composed components that remain independent of each other at every level, we create a system that is both resilient and flexible. Whether itâ€™s a monolithic application or microservices, this modular approach allows for easier updates, swaps, and scaling over time.
